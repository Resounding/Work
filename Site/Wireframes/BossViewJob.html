                <p>
                    They would like to put in some new kitchen cupboards, and flooring.
                    The current kitchen setup has been there for a number of years, and
                    is getting very dated. They would like oak cupboards and tile flooring,
                    they're not exactly sure on colours yet. They are also considering
                    new appliances, likely stainless steel.
